# 🧠 ProspectAI – Local Setup Guide

Welcome to **ProspectAI** – an internal research tool powered by Streamlit, n8n, and Docker.  
This guide walks you through cloning the repo, running the app, and accessing all features locally.

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed and running
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed
- Windows, macOS, or Linux

---

## Step 1: Clone the Repository

Open your terminal or PowerShell and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/khai-mle/ProspectAI.git
cd ProspectAI
``` 
## Step 2: Pull Prebuilt n8n Image
To avoid building locally, pull the pre-packaged n8n backend with built-in workflows:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/khai-mle/prospectai/n8n:latest
```
## Step 3: Start the App Stack
Run the following from the root folder:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

### What Starts

| Service      | Port(s)    | Description                              |
|--------------|-----------|------------------------------------------|
| **Streamlit** | `:8501`   | Chat interface and PDF download          |
| **n8n**       | `:5678`   | LLM + data‑automation backend            |
| **Postgres**  | *internal*| Stores n8n credentials / workflows       |
| **Qdrant**    | `:6333`   | Vector store for LLM embeddings          |
| **Traefik**   | `:80`, `:443` | Handles internal routing           |

> Access the tool in your browser: <http://localhost:8501>  
> *First‑time startup may take a minute as services initialize.*

## Step 4: Load the Pre‑Built Workflows

Download the JSON bundle workflows.zip from n8n folder. Then unzip workflows.zip
# You should now have a folder of *.json workflow files

Open http://localhost:5678

Click Workflows → Import

Drag‑and‑drop each .json file or select them all at once

Save & activate as needed

### Repo Structure

```text
├── streamlit_app/       # Python UI for user interaction
├── n8n/                 # Custom image folder (no build needed if pulling)
├── shared/              # Shared volume for logs, PDFs, etc.
├── docker-compose.yml   # Stack configuration
├── README.md
└── SETUP.md             # ← You are here


Stopping the App
To stop all services:

```bash
docker compose down
```
To stop and remove data volumes:

```bash
docker compose down -v
```
Notes
The n8n workflows and credentials are preloaded into the Docker image.
If changes are made to workflows, export and re-import as needed.
